### Projects
**Reflow Oven Controller @ UBC, Vancouver (_February 2025 - March 2025_)**
- Designed and implemented a reflow oven controller using a finite state machine (FSM) to regulate temperature profiles, improving
PCB soldering precision.
- Developed real-time temperature monitoring using a thermocouple and Python-based data logging, achieving an accuracy of ±3°C.
- Integrated automation features, including a servo motor for automatic oven door operation, a cooling fan, and an LED-based state
indicator for enhanced user experience.
- Implemented safety and optimization mechanisms, such as a PWM-controlled solid-state relay for precise heating control and an
automatic shutdown feature for overheating prevention.
